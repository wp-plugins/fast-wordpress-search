== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I always redirected to 404 page when activating this plugin =

This rarely happen, but in some cases it is because you have a large database and have lot of posts. It will redirected to 404 page because the PHP execution time is timeout. I suggest you to manually edit the table structure. If you need help contact me at ivan@ivankristianto.com .

= No post result found =

After installing this plugin allow 30 minutes for MySQL database indexing your post title and post content. In some cases it also no search result found. For this case contact me at ivan@ivankristianto.com so i can debug it. 

= Search result is not relevant =

Please allow sometimes for MySQL finish index your post title and post content. It depends to how much posts in your database.
